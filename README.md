Built using Power Apps, Power BI, SharePoint List and Power Automate â€“ Priori-Tees bridges the gap between planning ambition and execution reality.

ðŸ§  Problem Statement 


Sprint planning and backlog refinement often turn into idealistic wishlists, missing the nuance of what teams can actually deliver. Traditional models like MoSCoW or ICE lack the context of:

Execution complexity

Platform readiness

Cross-functional tradeoffs

Technical & business alignment
Problem Statement - For Product Teams which operate in a cross functional setup with multi geography and platforms, it becomes important to prioritize execution not just basis the need but also same baseline levels which prevents any miscommunication and misalignments. 
As we know that any task requires effort and understanding of why before we execute it, hence this tool to check the following:
1. Execution Complexity and Readiness
2. What are the potential impacts of undertaking this exercise across key dimensions both from Scrum Team and Business Team
