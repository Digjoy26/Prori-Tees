ðŸ§  Problem Statement 
For Product Teams which operate in a cross functional setup with multi geography and platforms, it becomes important to prioritize execution not just basis the need but also same baseline levels which prevents any miscommunication and misalignments. 
As we know that any task requires effort and understanding of why before we execute it, hence this tool to check the following:
1. Execution Complexity and Readiness
2. What are the potential impacts of undertaking this exercise across key dimensions both from Scrum Team and Business Team
3. What are the potential trade-off(s) that'll happen if we go ahead to miss something due to prioritization

At the very best, this tool and framework ensures qualitative asseseement gets translated to quantitative which gets converted to easy to understand business terms which can be used for wider audiences and part of stakeholder management
